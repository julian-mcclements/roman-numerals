# Roman Numerals

### Task

__Write a C# class that can convert any integer, in the range 1 to 10, into its matching Roman numeral. The Roman numeral should be returned as a string. This class should be created through Test-Driven Development (TDD).__

_If you have time you can try to extend your solution to handle larger numbers._

### What We Are Looking For

You will be pair programming with another developer on this task. Communication is important!

Any solution must be created by Test-Driven Development.

### Background

Roman numerals are a numeral system that originated in ancient Rome and remained the usual way of writing numbers throughout Europe well into the Late Middle Ages. 

Numbers in this system are represented by combinations of letters from the Latin alphabet. There are seven letters used in Roman numerals. Each letter has a fixed integer value.

| Symbol | Value|
|--------|------|
| I      | 1    |
| V      | 5    |
| X      | 10   |
| L      | 50   |
| C      | 100  |
| D      | 500  |
| M      | 1000 |

The chart below shows some sample integers and their matching Roman numerals.

There is no need to convert numbers larger than 1000.

The Romans did not know about zero, or negative integers. These numbers cannot be converted into Roman numerals.
